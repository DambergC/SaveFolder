*                4. Flashing Back to an Older Level of BIOS                 *
*                                                                           *
*    In order to flash back to an older level of BIOS, the following        *
*    steps should be used to insure the latest flash utility is used.       *
*                                                                           *
*    1.  Make sure the item "Allow Flashing BIOS to a Previous Version" is  *
*        set to "Yes" in BIOS setup security page.                          *
*        Obtain the older level and latest level BIOS update programs       *
*        from the Lenovo website.                                           *
*    2.  Use the method described in section 3 to unpack the program into   *
*        the default folder "C:\SWTOOLS\FLASH\M1AJYnnUSA\**"                *
*        or your preferred folder "d:\mypath" as an example.                *
*    3.  Copy imagem1a.rom from the older BIOS update program folder,       *
*        paste it and replace the same file in the latest level BIOS        *
*        update program folder.                                             *
*    4.  In the latest level BIOS update program folder, run flash.cmd      *
*        to flash back to an older level BIOS.                              *
*                                                                           *

*                                                                           *
*  1.The BIOS update process consists of two phases. The first phase        *
*    happens in the OS. After the first flashing phase is complete, the     *
*    system will automatically reboot to perform the secondary              *
*    BIOS update phase.                                                     *
*                                                                           *
*  2.Deploy mode is designed for BIOS update deployment when the            *
*    administrator wants to manually control the system reboot after first  *
*    BIOS phase update has finished. With the parameter "/quiet" or "/sccm",*
*    the system won't reboot immediately after applying the first phase of  *
*    the BIOS update.                                                       *
*                                                                           *
*  3.The administrator must REBOOT/SHUTDOWN the system later to             *
*    trigger the secondary phase of the BIOS update.                        *
*                                                                           *
*    Important Notes:                                                       *
*                                                                           *
*    1. After the first phase of the BIOS update is complete, the           *
*       administrator must REBOOT or SHUTDOWN the system to trigger         *
*       the secondary phase.                                                *
*    2. The REBOOT mentioned in Note 1 will trigger the secondary phase     *
*       immediately. It only works if  Setup was set to boot in UEFI mode.  *
*       It does not work if Setup was set to boot the system in Legacy mode *
*    3. The SHUTDOWN mentioned in Note 1 must be an actual                  *
*       S5 (System Power Off). The default shutdown behavior in             *
*       modern OS (WIN8/WIN8.1/WIN10 etc.) is S4 (Hibernate). To change     *
*       these modern OS shutdown behavior to S5, you need to turn off       *
*       the "Fast Startup" from "Control Panel -> Power options". If your   *
*       deployment software supports S5 shutdown, you can send a sleep S5   *
*       command by software to trigger the secondary BIOS update phase.     *
*       If the system is not shut down using the S5 shutdown, the flash     *
*       process will not continue, and will need to be restarted from       *
*       phase 1.                                                            *
*                                                                           *
*    The following example shows how to use /quiet to implement first phase *
*    BIOS update with deployment software:                                  *
*                                                                           *
*       flash.cmd /quiet                                                    *
*       or                                                                  *
*       wFlashGUIx64.exe /quiet                                             *
*                                                                           *
*    The following example shows how to use /sccm to implement first        *
*    phase BIOS update with deployment software:                            *
*                                                                           *
*      wFlashGUIx64.exe  imagem1a.rom /sccm                                 *
*                                                                           *
*    The deployment software can unpack the installation files into the     *
*    default folder without running the BIOS update program by using these  *
*    parameters on the OS flash package:                                    *
*                                                                           *
*    M1AJYnnUSA.exe /verysilent /extract=yes                                *
*                                                                           *
*    The deployment software can also unpack the installation files into    *
*    the default folder and implement first phase BIOS update in quiet mode *
*    using these parameters on the OS flash package:                        *
*                                                                           *
*    M1AJYnnUSA.exe /verysilent /quietflash                                 *
*                                                                           *
*    If the Supervisor Password was set and the setting                     *
*    "Require SVP when Flashing" was set to "Yes", it needs the password    *
*    authentication during the update process.                              *
*    To improve usability, a new parameter to pass the password to the      *
*    flash package has been added:                                          *
*    For example, if the password was "psw123",                             *
*    please implement the deploy mode as below                              *
*                                                                           *
*    M1AJYnnUSA.exe /verysilent /quietflash  /pass:psw123                   *
*                                                                           *
*                                                                           *
*    If the software package is already unpacked, you can run               *
*    Quietflash.cmd to silently update the system firmware.                 *
*                                                                           *
