Flash BIOS update - Flash from Operating System version
for ThinkCentre M910t, M910s, M910q, M910x, M710q, ThinkStation P320 Tiny
Version M1AKT59A
Installation README

This package updates the basic input/output system (BIOS) on
all ThinkCentre M910t, M910s, M910q, M910x, M710q, ThinkStation P320 Tiny systems.

BIOS is programming that controls low-level hardware operations,
including interactions with diskette drives, hard disk drives,
and the keyboard. The BIOS is stored on a chip.  Your computer
uses flash BIOS, which can be updated through a program on a 
flash diskette so that you do not have to replace the BIOS
chip to update the BIOS.

Do not write protect the flash diskette as this may cause the
flash process to hang.
