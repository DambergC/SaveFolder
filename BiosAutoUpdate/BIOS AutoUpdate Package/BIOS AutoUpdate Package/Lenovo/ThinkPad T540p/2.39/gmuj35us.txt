NOTES
- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.38 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.38 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.28 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.28 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.24 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.24 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.21 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.21 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.17 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.17 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.15 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.15 for security improvement.

- Since the UEFI BIOS version 2.13, the option for Intel Smart Connect
  Technology has been added into ThinkPad Setup menu (Disabled by default), and
  Setup Default by the F9 key will disable it. To use it, change the option to
  Enabled. (The UEFI BIOS version 2.11 or lower enabled it.)

- In case that your computer has been registered by ThinkVantage Hardware
  Password Manager with the UEFI BIOS version 2.09 (GMET61WW) or earlier, you
  should deregister your computer from ThinkVantage Hardware Password Manager
  before updating the UEFI BIOS to version 2.10 (GMET62WW) or higher. Consult
  your IT administrator or the manual of ThinkVantage Hardware Password Manager
  about how to deregister the computer.

- Be aware that the OS Optimized Defaults option in the Restart menu of ThinkPad
  Setup should not be normally changed. Lenovo recommends to use the factory
  default setting for it, as follows.

                                                       OS Optimized Defaults
  - For Windows 10/8.1/8 64-bit Preload models         [Enabled]
  - For Windows 7                                      [Disabled]

  To install Windows 7, the OS Optimized Defaults option should be [Disabled].

  If the OS Optimized Defaults setting is changed, Setup Default by the F9 key
  will not load the same default configuration, as follows. Furthermore, by the
  condition of Operating System installation, the computer may not be booted due
  to the setting change.

  If your computer runs satisfactorily now, you have no need to change the OS
  Optimized Defaults option. If you need to change the setting, consider well
  the effect of the setting change.

  Affected Setup menu items :
  "OS Optimized Defaults" setting          [Disabled] case      [Enabled] case
  - Security
    - UEFI BIOS Update Option
      - Secure RollBack Prevention         [Disabled]           [Enabled]
    - Secure Boot
      - Secure Boot                        [Disabled]           [Enabled]
  - Startup
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot                     [Both]               [UEFI Only]
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority            [Legacy First]       (Not shown)
    - CSM Support                          [Yes]                [No]

  By the OS to be newly installed, you need to change the OS Optimized Defaults
  option, and load default configuration.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Restart, then select OS Optimized Defaults and press Enter.
  3. Select the following setting and press Enter.
       [Enabled]   (for Windows 10/8.1/8 64-bit)
       [Disabled]  (for Windows 7)
  4. Press the F9 key to load default configuration.
  5. Select Yes.
  6. Press the F10 key to save default configuration and exit.
  7. Select Yes.
     The computer will be restarted automatically.

- Lenovo recommends to install the USB 3.0 driver for Windows (Version 1.0.4.225
  or higher) prior to updating the UEFI BIOS. Because the UEFI BIOS requires the
  modification in the USB 3.0 driver to fix USB 3.0 related issues.

  (Caution)
  If both the Secure Boot option is Enabled and UEFI Secure Boot in the Main
  menu of ThinkPad Setup is shown as Off, restoring Factory Keys is needed. Do
  the following to restore Factory Keys.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Security, then select Secure Boot.
  3. Select Restore Factory Keys, and press Enter.
  4. Select Yes to restore Factory keys.
  5. Press the F10 key to save configuration and exit.
  6. Select Yes.
     The computer will be restarted automatically.

- To enable 30 Day standby feature of ThinkVantage Power Manager, the computer
  has to disable waking computer by network adapters and USB devices. Uncheck
  the checkbox next to "Allow this device to wake the computer" in the Power
  Management tab for each device in Device Manager.

  should deregister your computer from ThinkVantage Hardware Password Manager
  before updating the UEFI BIOS to version 2.10 (GMET62WW) or higher. Consult
  your IT administrator or the manual of ThinkVantage Hardware Password Manager
  about how to deregister the computer.
- If your computer runs satisfactorily now, it may not be necessary to update
  the UEFI BIOS. To determine if you should update the UEFI BIOS, refer to the
  Version Information section.
