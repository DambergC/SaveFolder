for ThinkCentre E93, M73p, M83, M93, M93p, ThinkStation E32, ThinkStation P300
Version FBKTD8A
Installation README

This package updates the basic input/output system (BIOS) on
all ThinkCentre E93, M73p, M83, M93, M93p, ThinkStation E32, ThinkStation P300 systems

BIOS is programming that controls low-level hardware operations,
including interactions with diskette drives, hard disk drives,
and the keyboard. The BIOS is stored on a chip.  Your computer
uses flash BIOS, which can be updated through a program on a 
flash diskette so that you do not have to replace the BIOS
chip to update the BIOS.

Do not write protect the flash diskette as this may cause the
flash process to hang.

    ends, the system will automatically reboot to continue the flash
    process.

    your settings.
