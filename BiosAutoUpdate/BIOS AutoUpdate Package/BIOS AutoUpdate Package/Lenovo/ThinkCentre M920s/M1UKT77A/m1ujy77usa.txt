Flash BIOS update - Flash from Operating System version
for ThinkCentre M720t, M720s, M720q, M920t, M920s, M920q, M920x, ThinkStation P330 Tiny
Version M1UKT77A
Installation README

This package updates the basic input/output system (BIOS) on
all ThinkCentre M720t, M720s, M720q, M920t, M920s, M920q, M920x, ThinkStation P330 Tiny systems.

BIOS is programming that controls low-level hardware operations,
including interactions with diskette drives, hard disk drives,
and the keyboard. The BIOS is stored on a chip.  Your computer
uses flash BIOS, which can be updated through a program on a 
flash diskette so that you do not have to replace the BIOS
chip to update the BIOS.

Do not write protect the flash diskette as this may cause the
flash process to hang.

Print this file so that you can refer to it during the installation.

This flash under operating system (32-bit/64-bit) utility provides
the ability to update the system BIOS from a Windows application. 
                                              
The utility may be downloaded from the internet and unpacked into 
the default path: "C:\SWTOOLS\FLASH\M1UJYnnUSA", where "nn"  
represents the two-digit BIOS level. Please follow steps in  
section 2 to launch the Windows based flash application to update 
your system BIOS.

    Setup utility. They may have to be re-entered after updating  
    the BIOS.

    "cd C:\SWTOOLS\FLASH\M1UJYnnUSA", where "nn" represents the two  
    digit flash level.
