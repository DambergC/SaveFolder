NOTES

- If the UEFI BIOS has been rolled back to version 1.23 from higher version,
  CPU microcode (MCU) is also rolled back to older version than the one addressed
  for CVE-2017-5715.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.20 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.20 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.14 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.14 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.10 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.10 for security improvement.

- Intel Network Frame Forwarder (NFF) will be enabled from the UEFI BIOS version
  1.05. But, it will be disabled when updating the UEFI BIOS to version 1.05 or
  higher from version 1.04 or lower. Setup Default by the F9 key in ThinkPad
  Setup will enable it. It can be enabled or disabled in the ThinkPad Setup.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.03 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.03 for security improvement.

- Be aware that the OS Optimized Defaults option in the Restart menu of ThinkPad
  Setup should not be normally changed. Lenovo recommends to use the factory
  default setting for it, as follows.

                                                       OS Optimized Defaults
  - For Windows 10/8.1 64-bit Preload models           [Enabled]
  - For Windows 7                                      [Disabled]

  To install Windows 7, the OS Optimized Defaults option should be [Disabled].

  If the OS Optimized Defaults setting is changed, Setup Default by the F9 key
  will not load the same default configuration, as follows. Furthermore, by the
  condition of Operating System installation, the computer may not be booted due
  to the setting change.

  If your computer runs satisfactorily now, you have no need to change the OS
  Optimized Defaults option. If you need to change the setting, consider well
  the effect of the setting change.

  Affected Setup menu items :
  "OS Optimized Defaults" setting          [Disabled] case      [Enabled] case
  - Security
    - UEFI BIOS Update Option
      - Secure RollBack Prevention         [Disabled]           [Enabled]
    - Secure Boot
      - Secure Boot                        [Disabled]           [Enabled]
  - Startup
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot                     [Both]               [UEFI Only]
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority            [Legacy First]       (Not shown)
    - CSM Support                          [Yes]                [No]

  By the OS to be newly installed, you need to change the OS Optimized Defaults
  option, and load default configuration.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Restart, then select OS Optimized Defaults and press Enter.
  3. Select the following setting and press Enter.
       [Enabled]   (for Windows 10/8.1 64-bit)
       [Disabled]  (for Windows 7)
  4. Press the F9 key to load default configuration.
  5. Select Yes.
  6. Press the F10 key to save default configuration and exit.
  7. Select Yes.
     The computer will be restarted automatically.

  (Caution)
  If both the Secure Boot option is Enabled and UEFI Secure Boot in the Main
  menu of ThinkPad Setup is shown as Off, restoring Factory Keys is needed. Do
  the following to restore Factory Keys.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Security, then select Secure Boot.

  has to disable waking computer by network adapters and USB devices. Uncheck
  the checkbox next to "Allow this device to wake the computer" in the Power
  Management tab for each device in Device Manager.
