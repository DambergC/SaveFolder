NOTES

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.31 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.31 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.29 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.29 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.23 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.23 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.17 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.17 for security improvement.

- Be aware that the OS Optimized Defaults option in the Restart menu of ThinkPad
  Setup should not be normally changed. Lenovo recommends to use the factory
  default setting for it, as follows.

                                                       OS Optimized Defaults
  - For Windows 10/8.1 64-bit Preload models           [Enabled]
  - For Windows 7                                      [Disabled]

  To install Windows 7, the OS Optimized Defaults option should be [Disabled].

  If the OS Optimized Defaults setting is changed, Setup Default by the F9 key
  will not load the same default configuration, as follows. Furthermore, by the
  condition of Operating System installation, the computer may not be booted due
  to the setting change.

  If your computer runs satisfactorily now, you have no need to change the OS
  Optimized Defaults option. If you need to change the setting, consider well
  the effect of the setting change.

  Affected Setup menu items :
  "OS Optimized Defaults" setting          [Disabled] case      [Enabled] case
  - Security
    - UEFI BIOS Update Option
      - Secure RollBack Prevention         [Disabled]           [Enabled]
    - Secure Boot
      - Secure Boot                        [Disabled]           [Enabled]

    - CSM Support                          [Yes]                [No]

  By the OS to be newly installed, you need to change the OS Optimized Defaults
  option, and load default configuration.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Restart, then select OS Optimized Defaults and press Enter.
